Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p><img src="images/social-01.jpg" alt="Social"></div></div><article class="article-01" id="articleOne"><header><div class="header-info"><h2>Kitchen Remodeling Decisions You’ll Never Regret.</h2><span>Afraid your kitchen remodeling choices will look old school in a few years? Relax, we know how to make your kitchen timelessly and functional.</span></div></header><p>We see lots of kitchen trends at HouseLogic, so we know it’s easy to get swept along with what’s in vogue, only to get bummed out by your faddish design choices a few years later. Thank you — and damn you — Pinterest.</p><p>But chances are you’re only going to remodel your current kitchen once. After all, the annual “Cost vs. Value Report” from “Remodeling” magazine pegs the average price of a major kitchen remodel at $56,768. With that much on the line, you want to make all the right moves. If you do, you could recoup about 68% of your investment if you sell.</p><p>So we’re here to future-proof you from angst by naming the seven definitive kitchen features that will retain their beauty, marketability, and value — all while giving you lasting enjoyment.</p><p>White’s mojo:</p><ul><li>Throughout history, it’s been associated with happiness, purity (think Snow White), and new beginnings.</li><li>It’s a bright color that reflects light and makes even small kitchens feel larger.</li><li>It’s a neatnik’s dream — dirt has no place to hide.</li></ul><p>Even better, it’s uber-tolerant of both your budget and taste: A standard color for any manufacturer, you’ll find white cabinets, tile, counters, faucets, sinks, and appliances at any price point.</p><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-vintage-kitchen_8e9b72b6df2bf9e4e43f3c5fb4332496.jpg" alt="Ken Clark, Realtor"></p><p>And with a white backdrop, you can be as conservative or expressive as you want. After all, it’s about your enjoyment, not just dollars and cents. For example:</p><ul><li>Add your personal touch with colored glass knobs and pulls.<br><br><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-glass-knobs_5e67ed7a929aa555aee9f62f97747732.jpg" alt="Alessia of Little Lessy"></li><li>Show off antique Fiesta ware on open shelves or in upper cabinets with glass fronts.</li><li>Paint walls the color du jour — even off-white!<br><br><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-paint-walls_c0981abdf5975416b7c531536f470405.jpg" alt="Lisa Damrosch"></li></ul><p>Heck, with a white palette, you can change your mind about paint color on a whim. Those all-white basics will make any hue you choose look fresh and contemporary.</p><h3>2. Hardwood for Flooring</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-wood-floor_5ffc6d752729c59e767e01927581e2a2.jpg" alt="RJK Construction, Inc."></p><p>It’s been our foot fetish for years. That’s especially true ever since hardwood flooring was mass-produced during the Industrial Revolution, making beautiful flooring readily available at a reasonable cost.</p><p>Today, more than half of home buyers who purchased a home without hardwood floors say they would have paid an extra $2,080 for them, according to the 2013 Home Features Survey from the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS®. And among buyers of any age, upwards of 80% say hardwood floors are “somewhat” or “very important.”</p><p>“It’s the one feature men and women agree on,” says Debe Robinson, NKBA treasurer and owner of Kitchen Expressions Inc. in Sheffield, Ala., who’s also worked in the flooring industry.</p><p>Why? The love of wood is in our genes. Our nesting instincts know that hardwood has warmth, personality, and makes our homes cozy and inviting. That’s why this clever chameleon pairs well with any kitchen style — from casual cottage and sleek contemporary to the most chi-chi Park Avenue traditional.</p><p>More reasons why wood flooring is the goof-proof option:</p><ul><li><b>Perfect for open floor plans.</b> It flows beautifully from the kitchen into adjoining rooms.</li><li><b>It’s tough.</b> Hardwoods such as oak, ash, and maple will shrug off your kitchen’s high-traffic punishment for years. Solid hardwood flooring can be refinished 10 to 12 times during it’s typical 100-year lifespan.</li><li><b>It’s eco-friendly.</b> Hardwood is considered a green building material when it’s certified by the Forest Stewardship Council and comes from sustainably managed forests.</li></ul><h3>3. Shaker Style for Cabinets</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-shaker-cabinets_f90557e4cd0b54a18b202e694058a72f.jpg" alt="Stacey Collins Design"></p><p>Thank heaven for the Shakers. While they were busy reducing life to its essentials, they made cabinets with clean, simple lines that will forever be in style.</p><p>Shaker cabinets are an enduring legacy of American style and, like wood flooring, have the knack for looking good in any setting. Their simple frame-and-panel design helps reduce the amount of busyness in a kitchen, making it a soothing, friendly place to be.</p><p>“In a kitchen with a timeless look, you want the cabinets to be part of the backdrop,” says Alan Zielinski, a former president of the National Kitchen and Bath Association. “You don’t want to be overpowered. You’re looking for plain, simple, clean lines.”</p><p>Those plain, simple, clean lines are a perfect fit for transitional style — a beautiful combo of traditional and contemporary styles. In fact, the National Kitchen and Bath Association says that after creeping up on traditional for years, transitional is now the most popular kitchen style.</p><p>As our families grow more diverse, transitional style will only get more popular. It lets us personalize and blend cultural influences — Latin, Asian, Mideastern — into our homes; it’s the perfect balance of old and new, just like Shaker-style cabinets.</p><h3>4. Carrara Marble for Countertops</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-calcatta-marble_74e813fdc242f66c1c76c34bb1eefa22.jpg" alt="Jennifer Thompson"></p><p>Carrara marble is a timeless classic that’s been used in homes for thousands of years. (Michelangelo’s “David” was carved from Carrara.) It’ll look as good in the next millennium as it does now.</p><p>Here’s why:</p><ul><li>Carrara’s lacy graining and subtle white colors look terrific in a white kitchen (or any kitchen, for that matter).</li><li>It has a whiteness you won’t find in other natural stones.</li><li>It’s readily available, making it less expensive than other high-end choices, such as quartz.</li><li>It’ll last for generations.</li></ul><p>If you Google it, you’ll find a lot of debate about it (and marble in general) because it stains easily. But if you want something truly timeless, Carrara is the answer. And with today’s sealants, the problem of staining is almost moot if you reseal once or twice a year.</p><p>Still not sold? Or don’t have the budget? Laminate countertops are relatively inexpensive and can be upgraded to stone when you do have the budget.</p><h3>5. Subway Tile for the Backsplash</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-subway-tile_5c88e02898ff91a69484b123713f792c.jpg" alt="A Lo and Behold"></p><p>Subway tile goes back to the early 1900s, when it was used to line New York’s first subway tunnels. Classic subway tiles are white, 3-inch-by-6-inch rectangles — a look that became popular in American kitchens and baths, and has stuck around ever since. Now it’s an iconic part of the American design vernacular, destined never to go out of style.</p><p>In the kitchen, ceramic tile excels as a backsplash, where it guards against moisture, is a snap to clean, lasts forever, and always looks classy.</p><p>Sure, a backsplash can be an opportunity for a blast of color and pattern, but neutrals will always be current and blend with any look. Plus, a subway tile backsplash and a marble countertop make a dashing couple that will stand the test of time.</p><p>To make it even more enduring, keep it achromatic and camouflage dirt with gray or beige grout.</p><h3>6. Ergonomic Design</h3><p>Adaptability and universal design features mean easy living at any age. A recent survey on kitchens from the American Institute of Architects points to the growing popularity of smart ergonomic design, a sign that kitchen adaptability will stay in vogue.</p><p>Smart ergonomics simply mean convenience — for young or old, party people or homebodies — a key factor when remodeling a kitchen that will function well, retain its value, and always feel right.</p><p>No matter you or your buyer’s current or future needs, everyone wins with these approaches:</p><ul><li><b>Create different countertop heights.</b> Standard height is 36 inches, but you can raise or lower sections of cabinets by altering the height of the base. Add color-match shim strips to the bases of countertops that don’t include sinks or appliances. You (or a new owner) can easily remove them or add to them to adjust the height.</li><li><b>Swap a standard range for a wall oven and a cooktop.</b> Ranges have fixed heights. There’s no getting around the fact you have to bend to access the oven. But a wall oven conveniently installs about waist-high.</li><li><b>Add pull-out shelves to base cabinets.</b> Lower cabinets with doors mean having to twist like a pretzel to see what’s inside. Pull-out shelves put everything at your fingertips.<br><br><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-smart-storage_6caec27d8cb946f6a63aeb0f82962b72.jpg" alt="My DesignDump"></li><li><b>Keep wide clearances.</b> Kitchens attract people, and with open floor plans, you’re apt to have folks hunting for snacks, helping you cook, or just hanging out while you prep meals. Keep traffic flowing with a minimum of 42 inches between counters and islands.</li></ul><h3>7. Smart Storage</h3><p>Today’s families store about 47% of their kitchen stuff outside the kitchen — in laundry rooms, basements, even sheds — according to data released at the 2013 Kitchen and Bath Industry Show.</p><p>We blame it on the fact that kitchens have evolved from a tucked-away place at the back of the house into a multiple-chef, multi-tasking space that’s the hub of family life. Plus, our love of open kitchens and stocking up at warehouse stores means less wall space and more stuff, kitchen design expert Robinson says.</p><p>The solution: smart storage. Cabinet manufacturers have you covered with nearly unlimited storage options — shelves and compartments that unfold, turn, extend, and slide.</p><p>But it’s not just about having storage, it’s about designing it smartly. Follow these guidelines to make your storage timeless:</p><p><b>Create a primary storage zone.</b> This is an area 30 to 60 inches high and within two feet on either side of your body. Store your most-used items here — your favorite work knives, measuring cups, salt and pepper for cooking, your trusty pots and pans. With one easy motion, you can grab what you use all the time.</p><p><b>Plan for the unknown.</b> A truly timeless kitchen anticipates and adapts to future needs, such as:</p><ul><li>A space that can easily convert to an office, wine storage, or a closet.</li><li>Lower cabinet spaces that can accommodate a wine cooler, under-counter refrigerator, a second dishwasher, or new must-have kitchen appliances on the horizon. (Remember when microwaves didn’t exist?)</li><li>An open space that fits a freestanding desk or favorite antique that can personalize the kitchen — no matter who owns the home.</li></ul><div class="social"><p>TOPIC: <span>Kitchen, Remodeling Ideas and Tips</span></p><img src="images/social-author.jpg" alt="Social"></div><div class="author"><img src="images/author.jpg" alt="Author"></div></article><article class="article-02" id="articleTwo"><header><div class="header-info"><h2>Elements of Transitional Kitchen Style</h2><span>This versatile style lets you blend old and new elements, personalize — feel free to get quirky! — and defy what’s faddish — all while retaining marketability.</span></div></header><p>Transitional style is coming into its own as a favorite kitchen design. In a recent survey by the National Kitchen and Bath Association, transitional design moved into the No. 1 spot for the first time, edging out the long-time champ, traditional.</p><p>The reason? Transitional style has universal appeal — it takes a trend-defying approach to design that’s cozy, elegant, and ensures a great return on your investment.</p><h3>Adding the basics</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-brick-backsplash_4253c0cfe4b9ed0451f9d6cebc553f53.jpg" alt="Emili Snitzer"></p><p>These Arizona homeowners made all the right transitional-style moves when they remodeled their kitchen:</p><ul><li>Anchored their scheme by painting their oak cabinets white.</li><li>Moved to a neutral palette by painting walls tan.</li><li>Mixed rustic and contemporary by adding a brick tile backsplash over sleek polished black granite countertops.</li><li>Brought in the warmth of wood with a black walnut island countertop.</li></ul><h3>Basic Neutral Come Alive</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-wood-floor_2417e54bb80426583895450ec7e3a2a3.jpg" alt="Katja"></p><p>A balanced blend of black, white, metal, and wood tones creates a textural depth that’s serene, yet never boring. The mix works great with minimal detailing — there’s a distinct absence of elaborate moldings and trim. Wood kitchen flooring is a favorite element that always feels warm and homey.</p><h3>Untraditional Materials</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-concrete-counter_b1212550657d4e6c9132666e32c0ffd5.jpg" alt="Natalie Roussy"></p><p>Unusual materials are fine, especially if they’re in keeping with the principles of no-regrets kitchen design, including simple detailing and subtle colors. These concrete countertops are handmade, but they have the one-of-a-kind look of a stone slab — adding an artisan’s touch is a favorite element of transitional style. This remodeled kitchen adds a sky-blue ceiling for a color pop. With transitional design as the foundation, changing paint colors is an easy way to alter your kitchenscape.</p><h3>A Little Dash of Quircky</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-chalkboard-backsplash_df3ed95bfc4885e46c32bb8d332e6b2b.jpg" alt="TheLetteredCottage"></p><p>Unique details give your kitchen personality and keep it from being formulaic. This chalkboard backsplash is fun for the family — and it’s even in tune with the transitional palette. Other ways:</p><ul><li>Bring in a favorite antique — a cupboard, pie safe, or other unique piece.</li><li>Liven up walls with kids’ artwork.</li><li>Use open shelves and tops of upper cabinets for staging unique dishes and pottery.</li><li>Add one-of-a-kind pendant lighting.</li></ul><h3>Blending New and Old Elements</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-subway-backsplash_3153c3520f0d1985655a5c6580584a3c.jpg" alt="Malorie"></p><p>Combining old and new brings together classic details and updated sensibilities. This remodeled kitchen in New Jersey has a subway tile backsplash and frame-and-panel cabinets — time-honored motifs that have been around for more than a century and continue to hold their value. They’re mixed with stainless steel appliances and a contemporary version of a butcher block countertop. Corbels are familiar old-school; these updated interpretations have simple, clean lines.</p><h3>Style Chameleon</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-white-cabinets_679ebdd0ccdd52799ae9fe539323e59a.jpg" alt="Amy H. Taylor"></p><p>Transitional style adapts easily to its surroundings. It’s modern, classic, and comfortable all at once. You might say this remodeled Oregon kitchen is contemporary, but blink once and you’ll see warm wood floors, wood countertops, open cottagey shelves, and timeless white cabinets with universal appeal.</p><h3>Personal Touches</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-boxes-bins_2583901f087d29043a162e382d568d04.jpg" alt="Junkin Junky"></p><p>It’s easy to warm up transitional style and keep it homey. These little storage bins are set on open shelves so they get plenty of show time, and their honey-colored exterior is right in keeping with transitional’s neutral palette.</p><h3>Make It Your Own</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-streamlined-farmhouse_dfedacba0cd658a2167ee2ef11e52864.jpg" alt="Gretchen"></p><p>Streamlined farmhouse style is what these homeowners call their new kitchen; we’d say that fits perfectly in our definition of transitional — a kitchen that uses familiar, time-honored elements (check the classic subway tile backsplash and apron-front sink), a simple palette (white cabinets make everything right), and a touch of modern convenience (two dishwashers will handle anything you can throw at them).</p><div class="social"><p>TOPIC: <span>Painting, Lighting</span></p><img src="images/social-author.jpg" alt="Social"></div><div class="author"><img src="images/author.jpg" alt="Author"></div></article><article class="article-03" id="articleThree"><header><div class="header-info"><h2>7 Smart Strategies for Kitchen Remodeling</h2><span>Follow these seven strategies to get the most financial gain on your kitchen remodel.</span></div></header><ul class="project-info"><li><h4>Effort</h4><span>High 6-12 months</span></li><li><h4>Investment</h4><span>High $56,768</span></li><li><h4>Adds Value</h4><span>High $38,485</span></li></ul><p>Homeowners spend more money on kitchen remodeling than on any other home improvement project. And with good reason: Kitchens are the hub of home life and a source of pride.</p><p>A significant portion of kitchen remodeling costs may be recovered by the value the project brings to your home. Kitchen remodels in the $50,000 to $60,000 range recoup about 68% of the initial project cost at the home’s resale, according to recent data from “Remodeling” magazine’s “Cost vs. Value Report.”</p><p>A minor kitchen remodel of about $19,000 does even better, returning more than 79% of your investment.</p><p>To maximize your return on investment, follow these seven strategies to keep you on budget and help you make smart choices.</p><h3>Plan, Plan, Plan</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/kitchen-neutral-colors-kraftmaid_3x2_bc96aa6fa5db28517c10eddee5d7ff14_jpg_300x200_q85.jpg" alt="HouseLogic"></p><p>Planning your kitchen remodel should take more time than the actual construction. If you plan well, the amount of time you’re inconvenienced by construction mayhem will be minimized. Plus, you’re more likely to stay on budget.</p><p>How much time should you spend planning? The National Kitchen and Bath Association recommends at least six months. That way, you won’t be tempted to change your mind during construction and create change orders, which will inflate construction costs and hurt your return on investment.</p><p><b>Study your existing kitchen:</b> How wide is the doorway into your kitchen? It’s a common mistake many homeowners make: Buying the extra-large fridge only to find they can’t get it in the doorway. To avoid mistakes like this, create a drawing of your kitchen with measurements for doorways, walkways, counters, etc. And don’t forget height, too.</p><p><b>Think about traffic patterns:</b> Work aisles should be a minimum of 42 inches wide and at least 48 inches wide for households with multiple cooks.</p><p><b>Design with ergonomics in mind:</b> Drawers or pull-out shelves in base cabinets; counter heights that can adjust up or down; a wall oven instead of a range: These are all features that make a kitchen accessible to everyone — and a pleasure to work in.</p><p><b>Plan for the unforeseeable:</b> Even if you’ve planned down to the number of nails you’ll need in your remodel, expect the unexpected. Build in a little leeway for completing the remodel. Want it done by Thanksgiving? Then plan to be done before Halloween.</p><p><b>Choose all your fixtures and materials before starting:</b> Contractors will be able to make more accurate bids, and you’ll lessen the risk of delays because of back orders.</p><p><b>Don’t be afraid to seek help:</b> A professional designer can simplify your kitchen remodel. Pros help make style decisions, foresee potential problems, and schedule contractors. Expect fees around $50 to $150 per hour, or 5% to 15% of the total cost of the project.</p><h3>2. Keep the Same Footprint</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/kitchen-remodel-footprint-getty_6a7ac08195eb1facb01ebc54c51f20d6_3x2_jpg_300x200_q85.jpg" alt="Houselogic"></p><p>Nothing will drive up the cost of a remodel faster than changing the location of plumbing pipes and electrical outlets, and knocking down walls. This is usually where unforeseen problems occur.</p><p>So if possible, keep appliances, water fixtures, and walls in the same location. Not only will you save on demolition and reconstruction costs, you’ll cut the amount of dust and debris your project generates.</p><h3>3. Get Real About Appliances</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/kitchen-remodel-appliances-kitchenaid_423680beffce61891031b2d9ea6a087c_3x2_jpg_300x200_q85.jpg" alt="Houselogic"></p><p>It’s easy to get carried away when planning your new kitchen. A six-burner commercial-grade range and luxury-brand refrigerator may make eye-catching centerpieces, but they may not fit your cooking needs or lifestyle.</p><p>Appliances are essentially tools used to cook and store food. Your kitchen remodel shouldn’t be about the tools, but the design and functionality of the entire kitchen.</p><p>So unless you’re an exceptional cook who cooks a lot, concentrate your dollars on long-term features that add value, such as cabinets and flooring.</p><p>Then choose appliances made by trusted brands that have high marks in online reviews and Consumer Reports.</p><h3>4. Don’t Underestimate the Power of Lighting</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/kitchen-remodel-lighting-getty_9db5d3a131cd340e4c7bef64318b1b7f_3x2_jpg_300x200_q85.jpg" alt="HouseLogic"></p><p>Lighting can make a world of difference in a kitchen. It can make it look larger and brighter. And it will help you work safely and efficiently. You should have two different types of lighting in your kitchen:</p><p><b>Task Lighting:</b> Under-cabinet lighting should be on your must-do list, since cabinets create such dark work areas. And since you’re remodeling, there won’t be a better time to hard-wire your lights. (Here’s more about under-cabinet lights.) Plan for at least two fixtures per task area to eliminate shadows. Pendant lights are good for islands and other counters without low cabinets. Recessed lights and track lights work well over sinks and general prep areas with no cabinets overhead.</p><p><b>Ambient lighting:</b> Flush-mounted ceiling fixtures, wall sconces, and track lights create overall lighting in your kitchen. Include dimmer switches to control intensity and mood.</p><h3>5. Be Quality-Conscious</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/tips-kitchen-remodeling-counter-icestone_af826215161271251451e1ffd18bf45c_bJaHbko_3x2_jpg_300x200_q85.jpg" alt="HouseLogic"></p><p>Functionality and durability should be top priorities during kitchen remodeling. Resist low-quality bargains, and choose products that combine low maintenance with long warranty periods. Solid-surface countertops, for instance, may cost a little more, but with the proper care, they’ll look great for a long time.</p><p>And if you’re planning on moving soon, products with substantial warranties are a selling advantage.</p><h3>Add Storage, Not Space</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/kitchen-remodel-storage-rubbermaid_f822452920043c14a39a639e0c68af8d_3x2_jpg_300x200_q85.jpg" alt="HouseLogic"></p><p>Storage will never go out of style, but if you’re sticking with the same footprint, here are a couple of ideas to add more:</p><p><b>Install cabinets that reach the ceiling:</b> They may cost more — and you might need a stepladder — but you’ll gain valuable storage space for Christmas platters and other once-a-year items. In addition, you won’t have to dust cabinet tops.</p><p><b>Hang it up:</b> Mount small shelving units on unused wall areas and inside cabinet doors; hang stock pots and large skillets on a ceiling-mounted rack; and add hooks to the backs of closet doors for aprons, brooms, and mops.</p><h3>7. Communicate Clearly With Your Remodelers</h3><p class="image"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/kitchen-remodel-contractor-masterfile_3x2_a574229098dc8f93c27419bf6504df7e_jpg_300x200_q85.jpg" alt="HouseLogic"></p><p>Establishing a good rapport with your project manager or construction team is essential for staying on budget. To keep the sweetness in your project:</p><p><b>Drop by the project during work hours:</b> Your presence broadcasts your commitment to quality.</p><p><b>Establish a communication routine:</b> Hang a message board on site where you and the project manager can leave daily communiqués. Give your email address and cell phone number to subs and team leaders.</p><p><b>Set house rules:</b> Be clear about smoking, boom box noise levels, available bathrooms, and appropriate parking.</p><p><b>Be kind:</b> Offer refreshments (a little hospitality can go a long way), give praise when warranted, and resist pestering them with conversation, jokes, and questions when they are working. They’ll work better when refreshed and allowed to concentrate on work.</p><div class="social"><p>TOPIC: <span>Kitchen, Remodeling Ideas and Tips, Planning a Remodel</span></p><img src="images/social-author.jpg" alt="Social"></div><div class="author"><img src="images/author.jpg" alt="Author"></div></article></div><div class="panel panel-right trail"><ul class="trail-container"><li class="trail-container-box trail-one"><a href="#articleOne" class="trail-item"><div class="trail-item-img"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/classic-kitchen-remodeling-paint-walls_c0981abdf5975416b7c531536f470405.jpg" alt="Image"></div><div class="trail-item-title"><h3>Kitchen Remodeling Decisions You Will Never Regret</h3></div></a></li><li class="trail-container-box trail-two"><a href="#articleTwo" class="trail-item"><div class="trail-item-img"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/transitional-style-kitchen-wood-floor_2417e54bb80426583895450ec7e3a2a3.jpg" alt="Image"></div><div class="trail-item-title"><h3>Elements of Transitional Kitchen Style</h3></div></a></li><li class="trail-container-box trail-three"><a href="#articleThree" class="trail-item"><div class="trail-item-img"><img src="http://c0263062.cdn.cloudfiles.rackspacecloud.com/content/images/sized/kitchen-neutral-colors-kraftmaid_3x2_bc96aa6fa5db28517c10eddee5d7ff14_jpg_300x200_q85.jpg" alt="Image"></div><div class="trail-item-title"><h3>7 Smart Strategies for Kitchen Remodeling</h3></div></a></li></ul></div><h3 class="more-title">More In Kitchen</h3><img class="more" src="images/more.jpg" alt="More"><div class="question"><img src="images/question.png" alt="Question"></div></section><footer class="structure"><img src="images/footer.jpg" alt="Houselogic Footer"></footer><script src="scripts/main.js"></script></body></html>
